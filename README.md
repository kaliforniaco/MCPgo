# MCPgo
A tron clone, emulating the style of the mcp cone sector

Screen elements are at top end GOAL section, a 10x barrier array which constantly
shifts from left to right is just below that, with player core area at the bottom. 

Multi-directional player starts at bottom of core, barrier initiallizes with 3x10 and
grows to a maximum of 10x10, adding another row at shift 10 (+7), moves progressively
faster as player successfully destroys blocks. Player aims unilateral shots at barrier array, destroying individual blocks with each hit - player ammo automatically reloads 
upon hitting a block.

Intent is to clear a path through barrier thru which the MCP cone can be accessed, or winning by default by destoying all blocks in barrier.

Two players will alternate, and the first to enter MCP cone wins.
